The following are 3-dimensional test cases.

test_data.csv has one 5 by 5 by 5 block
test_data_1.csv is 20 by 20 by 20, has one 5 by 5 by 5 block, and one 20 by 20 by 1 block.
test_data_2.csv has two blocks crossing in the middle(might be seen as 3) and one block on the corner.
test_data_3.csv has four blocks on four corners of the cube, connecting them would get a Regular Tetrahedron.
test_data_4.csv has five blocks, the four blocks from test_data3 and one block in the middle of the cube.
